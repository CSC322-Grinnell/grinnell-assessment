# README

Welcome to the Grinnell Assessment Project! This project was originally developed for Grinnell's CSC324 course.

## About

This project seeks to map the connections between Grinnell College's goals on the institutional, departmental, and course levels.


## Setup

To start working on this project on your machine, you should have Rails 5.2.4.1 and Ruby 2.6.5 installed. (Other versions may work, but are not guaranteed to.)

Clone the repo to your machine, then run `bundle install`. Run `rake db:setup` to set up the database. You can then rails `rails s` to host the website locally for development.


## Deployment

The app is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://grinnellassessment.herokuapp.com/). If you are a member of a future CSC324 development team, contact your professor for information on how to deploy.
